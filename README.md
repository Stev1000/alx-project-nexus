# ALX Project Nexus: E-Commerce Backend-ProDev BE

 Overview

Project Nexus is part of the ALX ProDev Backend Engineering Program.
It serves as both:

A documentation hub to consolidate backend engineering learnings.

A real-world case study: building an E-Commerce Backend using Django + PostgreSQL.

This repository is designed to showcase:

Backend engineering concepts (REST APIs, GraphQL, Docker, CI/CD, async programming, caching).

## Challenges & solutions encountered during development

Best practices and personal insights gained throughout the program.

Collaboration efforts with fellow frontend and backend learners.

## Project Objectives

### Program Goals

Document major backend technologies, tools, and best practices.

Serve as a knowledge hub for current and future learners.

Encourage collaboration between frontend and backend learners.

### Project Goals

Build CRUD APIs for products, categories, and users.

Implement filtering, sorting, and pagination for efficient product discovery.

Secure endpoints with JWT authentication.

Document APIs with Swagger/OpenAPI.

Optimize database performance with indexing and ORM tuning.

Prepare deployment for public access.

## Tech Stack

Backend Framework: Django REST Framework (DRF)

Database: PostgreSQL

Authentication: JWT (djangorestframework-simplejwt)

API Documentation: Swagger (drf-yasg)

Containerization: Docker & Docker Compose

CI/CD: GitHub Actions (pipeline setup planned)

Other Concepts Covered:

GraphQL APIs (planned integration)

Celery & RabbitMQ (for async tasks)

Caching strategies with Redis

## Features (Planned & Implemented)

User Authentication

Register, login, and manage profiles (JWT-secured).

Product & Category Management

Full CRUD APIs.

Product Discovery

Filter by category.

Sort by price.

Paginate results for large datasets.

API Documentation

Interactive Swagger UI.

Database Optimization

Proper indexing and query optimization (select_related, prefetch_related).

## Backend Concepts, Challenges & Best Practices

Database Design: Normalized schema, foreign key constraints, indexing.

Asynchronous Programming: Planned Celery tasks for notifications.

Caching Strategies: Redis for frequent queries.

## Challenges & Solutions

Challenge: JWT token refresh and expiry handling.
Solution: Used SimpleJWT refresh tokens with blacklist support.

Challenge: Query slowness on large datasets.
Solution: Added database indexes and used select_related.

Best Practices & Takeaways:

Write clean, modular code (Django apps separation).

Follow 12-Factor App principles for deployment.

Use Conventional Commits for clarity in version control.

## Collaboration ‚Äì Key to Success

Collaborate with:

Fellow ProDev Backend learners (exchange ideas, code reviews).

ProDev Frontend learners (they‚Äôll consume your API endpoints).

Where to Collaborate:

Dedicated Discord Channel: #ProDevProjectNexus

ProDev Tip üí°

Use the first week to share which project you‚Äôre working on.

Connect with frontend learners building the frontend for this backend.
